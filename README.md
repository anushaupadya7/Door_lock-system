**Door Lock System ** 

**What it is?**
-->It is a simple interface matching to the door lock system. 
-->Usually authenticated doors consist of door locks & passwords are encrypted .
-->One can open the door & get in only if they press right passwords.
-->If they forget password , they can create new password using OTP.

**How it works?**
-->The numbers can be entered on clicking dial-buttons.
-->On clicking open button after entering password, if password matches the door is opened and displays a prompt "Welcome!". 
-->Else you get a prompt that your password is incorrect. 
-->We have also implemented a counter to set minimum of chances to try out passwords.
-->We have also kept an option to change password , the user has to enter old password & new password both. 
-->If the entered old password is correct, then the new password is created.

**Technologies used**
->HTML5 - For basic structure to arrange things using div & span.
-->CSS3 - For great UI.
-->JS3 - For updating contents & alert boxes.
